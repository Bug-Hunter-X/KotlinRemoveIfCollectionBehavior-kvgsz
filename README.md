# Kotlin removeIf() Behavior on Different Collection Types

This example highlights the behavior of the `removeIf()` function when used with `MutableList`, `MutableSet`, and `MutableMap` in Kotlin. While intuitive for lists and sets, the behavior on maps may be unexpected to some.

The `BugKotlinRemoveIf.kt` file demonstrates the code, and `SolutionKotlinRemoveIf.kt` (while not strictly needed here since the bug is illustrative, not a problem to be solved) explains the subtleties in a comment.  The README helps understand the nuances of using `removeIf()` on different collections.   This is a helpful demonstration, rather than an error requiring a solution.
